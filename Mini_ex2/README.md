(Click on the door and the fire will appear) 

I decided to create a simple looking program, but with a twist. I started with building the house with using simple shapes and syntaxes. I used the syntax "rect" to get the shape for the house, windows and chimney, then "ellipse" to get the round window and the illusion of smoke coming out of the chimney, "line" to get the lines inside the windows and at last "triangle" to make the roof. In contrast to the last program, I decided to add some variables to this code. I used it to add pictures and a "on" function. I added both a normal still picture (loadImage) and a GIF (createImage). There is a difference in using a still picture and a GIF. With a still picture you use "loadImage" to paste the picture into your program, but if you do the same with a GIF it won't have any movement. That's why you have to use the "createImage" function instead. At first, I didn't realize the different, so when a went to insert my GIF I started using "loadImage" and I didn't understand why I wouldn't work. But after playing with it and looking at other codes, I found my error. I also used the MousePressed function in this program, because I wanted to add an interactive experience to the user. That's my I created the house-on-fire aspect and the man running away to my program. 

I believe I made a somewhat fun program. I wanted to make something people could relate to and have a little fun playing with. That's why I created a normal looking house that with one specific click on the door turns into flames. I didn't think of any deeper meaning with this program. I just wanted to make something that articulated a mini game, and I think I somewhat succeeded with that.
