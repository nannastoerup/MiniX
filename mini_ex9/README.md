### What may be difficult when drawing a flowchart? 
For me the most difficult part of making a flowchart, is to decide what elements to include. When you have made a program that does a lot of things, you are almost forced to leave out some aspects of the program to make the flowchart understandable. It is also important to think about who you are making the program to. If you are making it to a non-coder, you can’t include coding-language in the flowchart. But if you are making it to a coder, some of the visual things may not be as important, and you should focus more on the code itself.

## #1 final exam project idea

This program should symbolize how the nature is in constant change and always generativity. 

### Technical difficulties
One of the primary difficulties in doing this is in the aesthetic expression. Since our program deals with simulating processes seen in nature, our code will have to mimic those, so that the viewer immediately knows, that it is a process seen in nature - i.e. growth seen in trees, plants, bushes and so on. We will have to research a lot about how to code processes seen in nature. Fortunately, Daniel Shiffman has made a series of videos about this subject, that we can use as a basis for our work.
   At the same time, we will have to define a limit in how far we will go in mimicking these processes. These are highly complex and could possible fill up thousands upon thousands lines of code. We don’t have the time nor the experience for this job, so we will have to limit ourselves. 
   
   
## #2 final exam project idea

This program is a face tracker that regulates the time for a throbber depending on your patience 

### Technical difficulties
The primary challenge in this idea is finding, understanding and implementing a face tracking library, capturing the webcam data and then connecting it to the throbber. In order to make the program run smoothly and without errors, we need to make sure we not only find and use a face tracking library, but seek a proper understanding of its functionality. If we don’t, we might constrain ourselves and our program to the surface-level-variables we can change. This could be a problem, as the understanding and aesthetics of the throbber will not be conveyed.
   Anothers challenge lies in defining both the qualities and our conceptual understanding of this throbber - does the data impact how fast this throbber ‘loads’ and how will we convey this message to the user
    Lastly, it’s important that we find a way to balance the penalty from being impatient and the reward for being patient. As an example: if the ‘end goal’ is instantly reached when patience is registered, the user won’t understand the impact she has on the program - same goes if the ‘end goal’ is never reached if impatuence is registered.

### How are the flowcharts different? 
The difference between the flowchart from my previous mini_ex’s and the flowchart for our final exam ideas, is how we made them. With our final exam flowcharts, we had to come up with an idea and then try to visualize it through the flowcharts, which was a great way of planning out the structure to the programs. Making the flowcharts for my own previous mini_exs, was more explaining how the program is build and not how it could be build. There was an outline to these flowcharts with having the code to refer back to. When creating the exam flowcharts, we constantly had to estimate what we could do or make in the future. 

### If you have to bring the concept of algorithms from flow charts to a wider cultural context, how would you reflect the notion of algorithms? 
Algorithms are everywhere. We experience them in day to day life. The text “"What Algorithms Want" by Ed Finn addresses how algorithms have become a part of our everyday without us even knowing it. 

*"Algorithms are everywhere. They already dominate the stock market, compose music, drive cars, write news articles, and author long mathematical proofs—and their powers of creative authorship are just beginning to take shape."* (p. 15)

I think this text is very interesting and creates focus on a subject many have no knowledge about but are depended on it every day. We do not know how things work; they just do. 
I believe we could invest more time to familiarize us with the things we constantly use, to have more understanding to why it works.
