# Depiction of our program 

The purpose of our program, is to show the amount of rain in a given city. We chose the city Ouibdó in Columbia because of the quantity of rain each day (estimated days with rain: 304 days), and it would therefore be easy to constantly have changing activities to our program. We chose to divide the amount of rain into categories: light-, medium- and heavy-rain to implement changes in the program. We used the API from a website called Openweather, which Daniel Shiffman also had used in a previous video. This made it more understandable for us, since none of us had worked with API’s before.
As you can see, nothing shows up on the screen when running the program. When uploading this mini ex, the API stopped sending data about rain to our program. The program had worked perfectly prior to this. The company has explained that this sometimes happens. On curtain days or hours, the data will stop communication with the program. Maybe/hopefully by the time you are running the program, the API has start working again and everything will work just fine.
If the program isn’t working here’s a quick description of it: short white lines will pour down the program. Depending on the about of rain the rain will pour down slow, faster or really fast. A text will also appear with either lightrain, mediumrain or heavyrain while the “rain” is pouring on the screen.  

# Reflection on the process 

Building the program from scratch was at the beginning hard for us, because of our lack of experience working with API’s. We therefore looked at Winnie’s example with Google images and Daniel Shiffman’s video about temperatures. This really helped us get started and gave us an idea to, how we should construct our program. We came up with the idea of using rain-data and visualize it in some way. We wanted to make something simple, so we could focus on making the API work. I found it hard to work with API’s, because of the lack of control over it. You could be working on the program and suddenly it would change or wouldn’t work. It was extremely frustrating. We often just sad and stared at the screen, trying to find the error. This mini ex was one of the toughest, I think, so far. I didn’t feel like I had control over what was going on which really frustrated me. I still don’t know the knowledge behind API’s, but I definitely have a better understanding of it. 

# Question for further investigation

If I was to investigate APIs additionally, I would focus on the effect they have for social media sites. You see the “sharing” icon on almost social media site, but is it really getting used?
