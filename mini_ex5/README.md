Describe how you program the objects and their related attributes and methods in your game.

My program/game is fairly simple. It consists of 5 circles in different colors to represent the Olympic Games. I kind of took inspiration from the resent Olympic Winter Games and thought of creating my own "game" in a different sense. You play the game by moving the running guy (mouse) round and when you touch the rings they'll move in different directions. There is no "end" to the game, but you can push the rings out to each side and then they'll disappear. 

Describe how you program the objects and their related attributes and methods in your game.

The rings are objects with attributes and methods. The colors, shape, size and position are the attributes to the objects. The method is the moving/sliding of the objects. To do the moving aspect with the objects, I have used if-statements. I have made if-statements to every ring with a different speed of moving with everyone. I believe I could have done this in a simpler and prettier way. 

Based on Shiftman's videos, Lee's text and in-class lecture, what are the characteristics of object-oriented programming?

Based on Shiftmans' videos, the text we read and our lecture; object-oriented programming is to break software into different objects that has a class, attributes and methods. You start off with the class of the object, which can be compared to the DNA or the blueprint of the object. The class is a description of the attributes. The attributes then characterize the object with for example color, size, etc. At last the method tells the object which action it shall make. 

Extend/connect your game project to wider digital culture context, can you think of a digital example and describe how complex details and operations are being abstracted and encapsulated?

I believe social media sites would be a great example to answering this question. When creating a profile, you have to choose between different types of people, and try to classify yourself to this site. At first you have to categorize yourself into a certain class: man or female. Then you have to build on your attributes: age, hobbies, address, eye color, etc. When you have done all of these then it's time to "play" with the site. You now have a lot of methods you can do/use on the sites: like, friend request, watch videos, post posts, etc. This is just a small example of how the digital culture today can relate to this subject.
