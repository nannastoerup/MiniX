Describe your first independent coding process (in relation to thinking, reading, copying, modifying, writing, uploading, sharing, commenting code)

I had fun experimenting with my first independent coding process/experience. I experienced with 3D shapes, rotating, colors and combining shapes. It was a different way to express yourself through coding and digital shapes. You had to think out of the box and figure out how to create what you had in mind. At first, I looked at the references at the p5.js website and copied it in to my sketch.js file. I saw how it affected the canvas in the browser, and decided to modify the code to get my desired program. I found out how sensitive coding is, because even the smallest mistakes made the whole program to crash or stop.  At times, it was kind of frustrating dealing with a program you had no prior experience with, because it made some unexpected changes sometimes. I think it’s interesting to express yourself in a different way than with words. 

How your coding process is different or similar to reading and writing text? 

It was definitely a different experience reading and writing code compered to “normal’ text. In everyday writing its more about spelling the words correct, but in coding you can experiment with different numbers in the codes and get a completely different answer or shape than the prior code. But at the same time coding and text are similar in other ways. For example, if you write a word wrong in Microsoft Word it will get underlined with red. This won’t happen when coding. When writing something wrong in coding, your program will simply just stop working as you wanted it to. This happened to me multiple times, and got me feeling frustrated at times. It was difficult to find the mistake sometimes, because you didn’t know what you were looking for. But then you just had to experiment and try different things to see what would help. This helped with understanding the coding process better, because you got challenged to figure out the solution yourself. 

What might be the potential and possibility of coding practice?

The only way to learn coding is to practice and experimenting with different syntaxes. This was from my experience the best way of understanding and learning how to code. I believe that coding can be used as a great visual tool to show of ideas and designs. That’s why I think learning, even if it just the basic, coding is important, because it is such a useful tool in the future. Sometimes it can be hard to describe a design or an idea with words, so it would be nice to know a different way to explain or show of a design.
