## Program details

We have created a narrative between a couple. It is a tragic materialistic love story between the hopeful Endor and 
the ungrateful Phin. Phin is obsessed with the thought of the perfect diamond ring and Endor can’t afford to give what 
Phin expect to get.
 
We have constructed the code as the narrative and choose to visualize the symbol of materialism in this story; the 
diamond ring. We have written the narrative as a code regularly could look like with variables, if statements and 
logical operators. Simply by looking at the program in the browser, you would have no idea what the story is about. 
You have to research and look into what the code really means. 

We decided to do the assignment this way, because we thought it was a interesting twist to e-literature. By creating 
something simple, as a diamond ring, visual and then actually writing the story as a manuscript, makes the meaning of 
e-literature stand out. To make the storytelling come alive we added sound files to play along while reading the dialog. 
Rasmus mixed snips from different songs/clips and made it into one sound file. We found it interesting to mix music 
genres with different meanings, and make it seem like it belonged together.  

This is how to read/understand our code:
1.	Run the program - with sound
2.	Find the [*narrative.js* file](https://github.com/nannastoerup/Mini_ex/blob/master/mini_ex7/empty-example/narrative.js) and read it like a dialog between two people. 

## What is the aesthetic aspects of your program in particular to the relationship between code and language?

Human language and computer/code language have multiple similarities and can easily be combined. In both languages 
the context and correct spelling as a huge factor, this is also mentioned in the text Vocable Code, seen here: *“The 
meaning of words are not derived from an inherent logical structure alone (…) but also from their social use.”*p. 32. It 
is very important to have context to what you are saying/writing. 
We have combined and mixed the way of using both languages in our program. We have done so, by writing a human story 
in coding language. It has been written with syntaxes and variables but is meant to be read in human language. We have 
shown, that writing a human story can be done by using computer language.
