(Try press the ENTER button on your keyboard)

With this program I wanted something to gradually change but still have an element that constantly was the same. I decided to create a program consisting of drawing circles with fading colors. I got this idea from a program by Clare Bond I saw on the Open Processing site under the generative search. Her program had some aspects that I wanted to implement to my own program. 

The first rule to my program was; constant moving. The second rule was; changing or fading of colors. At first, I had only made one circle in the middle of the screen and then I wanted that to change between all the colors of the rainbow. But the more I looked at the circle, the more boring and unaspiring it became. Last week I created a program about the Olympic and I used the Olympic rings as a big part of the program. I thought of combining last week and this week might be a great idea. The I came up with creating multiple drawing circle and each have a different color that fades. It would make the program feel more “alive” and interesting to look at.

My program is being generated by the constant movement of the circles and the color changing. 

I added the keyPressed function because I wanted to implement a way to reset/start over the program. I tried different things and watched plenty of videos on how to do it, but I couldn’t get it to work like I wanted. I finally found a way to almost reset the program, but not quite what I wanted. Now when you press the ENTER button it redraws the circles from were in the process it is come to. So, if the red circle has faded to a light pink color and is at the coordinates 100,100, when you the press the KEY button it deletes the previous drawn lines in the circle and then redraws the circle starting at the 100,100 coordinates with a light pink color (if that makes sense). 

If you look at my code I know I could have made it so much prettier and made the circles into objects. But I didn’t feel like I learned exactly how to make objects work. I wanted to create a program totally from scratch and with no help or by coping another code. That is way I decided to make the code in a way I could understand it and have control over what happened and why it happened. Because I sometime feel, if we are supposed to use a certain syntax I often don’t understand why or how it does it. So I wanted to create a code for myself and I know what everything does to the program, which I’m really happy with. 

This mini-exercise has helped me by understand what generativity can be by seeing all the different ways of expressing generativity. Especially the Open Processing site have helped me to understand a lot. There had some great examples of what generativity could be.
