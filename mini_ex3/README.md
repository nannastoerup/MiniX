My throbber program is based on Winnies created function drawThrobber.  In this program I used primarily one simple shape, the triangle, and duplicated it 12 times to create a throbber. I also added two variables, both to create the text element in my program. I decided to apply the mousePressed function to the text, instead of leaving the statically, because I wanted to a small interaction with my program. In my code you can see I have added a picture which didn't get used. I decided to leave it in the code in case I wanted to switch between my ideas. 

A throbber, to me, symbolizes unnecessary waiting or bad connection. It is a frustrating thing/icon. But at the same time, it gives me some kind of belief that the program is working on fixing the problem. In that sense it is a paradox, because it gives me a feeling of irritation but also a confirming that progress is being made. The throbber gives you something to focus on while the program is going through a bunch of technical things you have no idea about. 
Many of the throbbers in today's medias are special made for that specific website, which makes you think of that website when seeing the throbber. In a that way, the throbber becomes a part of the branding of the brand. 
Working with throbbers and trying to rethink them, makes you understand their meaning. I kept on coming up with ideas, but every time it ether already existed, or I didn't even make sense. I found this process extremely frustrating, because I couldn't come up with an original great idea. In the end, I decided to create a simple throbber but add the interactive part. When you bump into a throbber in real life, you sometime wish you could in some way interact with it.
