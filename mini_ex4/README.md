Press the buttons to give your answers. 

This program consists of one question with a limited number of answers. The answers are made with the button function, so when you press it a counter is connected to it and count the answers. My idea with the program, was to collect data from every user of the program and have the counter count everyone's answers, so it's constantly changing. Originally, I used "normal" eye colors, but I decided to use more atypical colors instead. The reason for this, was to make a more critical design. The color of your eyes can be related to the color of your skin, just in a smaller spectrum. You are put into categories depending on your eye or skin color. An aspect you don't get to choose yourself. So, I wanted to create something the in the same way categorizes you, but in a light hearted and silly way. The reason for the limited amount of answers, is referring to the skin/eye color separation again. For many you can only be certain skin colors: white, black or yellow. But that isn't true. There are multiple shades of people. But you quickly get categorized as one or the other. It's a very narrow way of thinking, and I wanted to show how silly it is with this program. 
When creating this program, I used different syntaxes, but I mainly used the "button" function. After learning about it, I wanted to try using it myself. I feel like that is the best way to learn. I also used different counting syntaxes, to collect the data coming through the program. I wanted to add a blinking eye that would pop up every time you pressed one of the buttons, but I couldn't get it to work. Another thing I wanted to add, was the user only could press a button one time each day, but that wasn't possible to make I this program. At the end I also added the changing of the background colors. I did this to influence you pick of desired eye color.

When I first started making the program, I had no idea what to make. Then I just started making something simple as collecting peoples eye color. Then it gradually progressed into something quite deep. I don't know if my program has given me a better understanding of data capturing. But a lot of other things have. For example, I find documentaries about surveillance very scary but also extremely fascinating. There is so much stuff going on, you just have no idea about or control over.
